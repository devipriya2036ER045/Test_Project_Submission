toxic element of the body and plays a major role in metabolism and serving several vital functions. The 
liver is the largest glandular organ of the body. It weighs about 3 lb (1.36 kg) .The liver's main job is to 
strain the blood coming from the digestive tract, before passing it to the rest of the body. The liver also 
detoxifies chemicals and metabolizes drugs.<br>As it does so, the liver hides bile that ends up back in the 
intestines. The liver also makes proteins important for blood clotting and other functions.The liver supports 
almost every organ in the body and is vital for our survival. Liver diseases are diagnosed based on the liver functional test.
Some of the diseases are Wilson's disease,liver cancer, and cirrhosis.</div>
